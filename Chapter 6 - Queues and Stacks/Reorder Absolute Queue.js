// Rob sees the world in clear black-and-white terms. Scott, however, is more likely to say "it depends" and see shades of grey. Create a standalone function that accepts a Queue of numbers, sequenced in absolute-value order, such as (10, -20, 30, -40, 50). Using only an additional Stack for storage, reorder the Queue values so that they are in increasing order, such as (-40, -20, 10, 30, 50).
